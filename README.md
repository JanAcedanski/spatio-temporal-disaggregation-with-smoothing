# Spatio-temporal disaggregation of time series with smoothing and regression-based algorithms

The repository contains Julia codes for:
- spatio-temporal disaggregation of annual time series into quarterly ones
  using smoothing and regression-based methods (disaggregation folder)
- performing a pseudo-real-time nowcasting experiment for both methods (nowcasting folder)

The main files:
- disaggregate_all.jl for disaggregation
- do_all.jl for nowcasting experiment

The repository accompanies the paper:
Jan Aceda≈Ñski, "Disaggregation and nowcasting of regional GDP series with
a simple smoothing algorithm", Journal of Official Statistics, submitted
