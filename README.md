# Spatio-temporal disaggregation of time series with smoothing and regression-based algorithms

The repository contains Julia codes for:
- spatio-temporal disaggregation of annual time series into quarterly ones using smoothing and regression-based methods (main script: disaggregate_all.jl)
- performing a pseudo-real-time nowcasting experiment for both methods (main script: do_all.jl)

The repository accompanies the paper:

Jan Aceda≈Ñski, "Disaggregation and nowcasting of regional GDP series with
a simple smoothing algorithm", Journal of Official Statistics, submitted
